# Abstract Simplicial Complex Samplers

This folder contains a series of scripts and functions for sampling on the space of abstract simplicial complexes of a fixed number of roots. The code is largely self-documenting.

maskDigraphCoins.m is the uniform Kahle sampler, while maskDigraphLatest and topologyChain are free samplers/random walks. For details, see preprint.pdf for a preprint of the publication.

This code is available for academic and personal usage and modification for any open project with appropriate attribution to the original author, John Lombard. The work of other authors noted within (and accompanied by their respective licences) is seperately handled.

This code may not be maintained regularly and does not guarantee correctness, but is provided in the interest of an open-science initiative and to provide a snapshot of current field research.
